# Proposed Concept: "Cosmic Critters: Race Through Time"

## Core Gameplay

- Players control cute alien creatures racing through time-warped maps.
- The game is a mix of cooperative and competitive play, emphasizing fun over violence.

## Key Elements

1. Map:
   - Rectangular map with rooms, pathways, and hidden areas.
   - Each map represents a different time period (prehistoric, medieval, future, etc.).
   - Random events can alter the map (e.g., dinosaur appearance, robot malfunction).

2. Time Constraint:
   - 8-10 minute rounds.
   - Day/night cycle affects visibility and gameplay.
   - Weather changes influence character abilities.

3. Multiplayer:
   - 2-6 players per game.
   - Characters have varying stats: speed, size, and special abilities.
   - No health or damage; instead, focus on racing and collecting.

4. Goals and Progress:
   - Main goal: Collect time crystals scattered across the map.
   - Secondary objectives: Complete fun mini-tasks specific to each time period.
   - Risk/reward: Choosing between easier paths or riskier routes with more rewards.

5. Trading System:
   - Players can trade collected items at "time bazaars" on the map.
   - Trade for temporary power-ups or map information.

6. Game Rules:
   - Win condition: First to collect a set number of time crystals or most crystals when time runs out.
   - Lose condition: None (it's all about fun and improvement).
   - Replay value through randomized maps and events.

7. Communication:
   - Simple chat system with preset messages for safety.
   - In-game interactions like helping others or playful pranks.

8. Setting:
   - Sci-fi meets history: Cute alien characters travel through Earth's timeline.
   - Emphasis on education through fun historical elements.

## Next Steps

1. Detailed Game Design Document:
   - Flesh out character designs and abilities.
   - Create a list of potential maps and their unique features.
   - Design the UI and game flow.

2. Prototype Development:
   - Start with a basic version of one map and two characters.
   - Implement core mechanics: movement, collection, and time limit.

3. Playtesting:
   - Test with the target audience to gauge engagement and understanding.
   - Iterate based on feedback, focusing on fun and ease of play.

4. Art Style Development:
   - Create concept art for characters and environments.
   - Ensure the style is appealing to the target age group.

5. Technical Planning:
   - Choose a game engine (Unity might be a good fit).
   - Plan for multiplayer implementation and Steam integration.
