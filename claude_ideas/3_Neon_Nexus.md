# Neon Nexus: Hack the System

## Core Concept

A cyberpunk-themed strategy game where players are hackers manipulating a sprawling digital cityscape in real-time. The game blends elements of tower defense, resource management, and competitive multiplayer.

## Key Gameplay Elements

1. Grid-Based Digital City:
   - The game takes place on a neon-lit grid representing various city systems.
   - Players compete to control key nodes and data streams.

2. Hacking Mechanics:
   - Use various "programs" to infiltrate, defend, or manipulate different parts of the grid.
   - Each action consumes energy and takes time to execute.

3. Resource Management:
   - Manage bandwidth, processing power, and data as crucial resources.
   - Capture and maintain control of resource nodes to fuel your operations.

4. Dynamic Defense Systems:
   - Set up firewalls, virus scanners, and counter-hack measures.
   - Adapt defenses in real-time as opponents attempt to breach your territory.

5. Asymmetric Gameplay:
   - Choose from different hacker archetypes, each with unique abilities and playstyles.
   - Examples: The Ghost (stealth specialist), The Juggernaut (brute-force expert), The Puppeteer (AI manipulation master).

6. AI Subsystems:
   - Interact with or manipulate AI-controlled city services.
   - Use them to your advantage or disrupt opponents' strategies.

7. Time Pressure Mechanics:
   - Race against a "trace" timer that increases with each action.
   - Balance aggressive plays with the risk of being detected and locked out.

8. Evolving Battlefield:
   - The city grid changes dynamically as players interact with it.
   - Temporary power outages, security breaches, and system crashes alter the playing field.

9. Modular Program System:
   - Customize your toolkit by combining different program modules.
   - Discover synergies and create unique strategies.

10. Objective-Based Gameplay:
    - Multiple win conditions based on different objectives (e.g., data extraction, system control, opponent lockout).
    - Players can pivot strategies mid-game to pursue alternative victory paths.

11. Bluffing and Misdirection:
    - Use decoy programs and false signals to mislead opponents.
    - Information warfare is as crucial as direct confrontation.

12. Escalating Complexity:
    - Start with basic hacking tools and gradually unlock more sophisticated techniques.
    - Late-game actions can have city-wide impacts, raising the stakes dramatically.
