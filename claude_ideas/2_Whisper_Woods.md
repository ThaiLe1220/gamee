# Whisper Woods: Echoes of the Forgotten

## Core Concept

A single-player, atmospheric puzzle-adventure game where sound is the primary mechanic. The player, a young forest spirit, must restore harmony to a once-vibrant magical forest that has fallen silent.

## Key Gameplay Elements

1. Sound-Based Interaction:
   - Player emits various tones or "whispers" to interact with the environment.
   - Different whispers have unique effects (e.g., growth, movement, reveals hidden paths).

2. Echo Location:
   - Use sound waves to navigate in dark or obscured areas.
   - Solve puzzles by listening to how sounds reflect off objects.

3. Rhythm Puzzles:
   - Unlock certain areas or activate mechanisms by replicating specific sound patterns.
   - These patterns become more complex as the game progresses.

4. Sound Collection:
   - Gather lost "sound essences" throughout the forest.
   - Combine these to create new whispers with different effects.

5. Stealth Elements:
   - Avoid or pacify corrupted creatures attracted to noise.
   - Use sound strategically to distract or lure entities.

6. Environmental Storytelling:
   - Uncover the forest's history by restoring sound to different areas.
   - Each area reveals part of the narrative through ambient sounds and visual changes.

7. Dynamic Sound Design:
   - The forest gradually comes alive with sounds as you progress.
   - Player actions directly influence the game's evolving soundtrack.

8. Whisper Companions:
   - Befriend small creatures that provide unique whispers or abilities.
   - Use these companions to solve cooperative puzzles.

9. Sound-Reactive Flora:
   - Interact with plants that respond to different frequencies.
   - Use this to create paths, reveal secrets, or solve environmental puzzles.

10. Harmony Restoration:
    - Major puzzle set-pieces involve restoring large, complex sound structures.
    - These act as both progress markers and spectacular audio-visual rewards.
